# Serverless Facebook Messenger Bot in Node.js and AWS

## Introduction

This example app will run on top of AWS serverless services such as:

- AWS DynamoDb
- AWS Lambda
- AWS REST API Gateway

The IaS (Infrastructure as Code) `.yml` file has been provided to help you deploying any necessary resources to run the application.

## What you can do with this app

- Say hi to initiate the chat bot app and talk to Bot
- Get any messages on REST API
  - /messages
  - /messages/:msg_id
  - /summary
- Deploying serverless based app

## How to deploy

### Prerequisite

- AWS Cloudwatch only showing the AWS lambda logs when you intentionally write logs to console
- You need to create Business Page on Facebook to do integration with fb-messenger
- You must subscribe to `messages` & `messaging_postbacks` webhook events on FB-messenger setup page
- Also read this external resources for preparing your own integration and deployment :

  - [FB-Messenger for developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started)
  - [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)
  - [AWS Cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)

- Make sure your choice of AWS Regions support any of this services:

  - AWS DynamoDb
  - AWS Lambda
  - AWS REST API Gateway
  - AWS Elastic IP

### Requirement

- NodeJs version >= 12.x.x
- Facebook webhook version 13.0
- Facebook developer account
- AWS Account
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS SAM installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

### Apps and serverless resources deployment
Choose one from the two options below.

#### CI/CD deployment with AWS Code pipeline and automated testing
1. RUN `sam pipeline bootstrap` will bootstraping all the required AWS resources to connecting CI/CD system
2. RUN `sam deploy -t codepipeline.yaml --capabilities=CAPABILITY_IAM --stack-name <STACK-NAME>  --region <AWS-REGIONS> --parameter-overrides ProdStackName=<STACK-NAME>`
3. After creating the stack, the CodeStar Connection is in PENDING status by default. You must complete the OAuth handshake with the third-party provider using the installation associated with your connection via AWS console
4. RUN `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <STACK-NAME> --region <AWS-REGIONS>` to get endpoint URL on stack `Outputs`

#### Manual deployment with AWS SAM
1. Change `WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` env placeholder of your choice on serverless.yml
2. Change `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env placeholder on serverless.yml. Get generated access tokens from FB for Developer App Page on messenger settings 
3. RUN `sam build -t serverless.yml` on projects root folder
4. RUN `sam deploy --guided` on projects root folder
   - enter stack name of your choice (ex: bot-test-app)
   - enter `ap-southeast-1` for AWS regions
   - choose `N` for Confirm changes before deploy ?
   - choose `Y` for Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation
   - choose `N` for Disable rollback
   - choose `Y` for Save arguments to configuration file
   - choose default name for SAM configuration file [samconfig.toml]
   - choose default name for SAM configuration environment [default]
5. Notes the Cloudformation output value of `endpointApi` when successfully finished SAM deployment as your REST API base URL
6. Add URL from point 5 as callback URL on FB-Messenger for developer setup page
   - Add `/webhook` path to base URL (ex: https://BASE_URL/webhook)
   - Add `Verify token` with the same token of your choice as point no.1 
7. Go to the FB-Page you created before and say hi on chat

### How to clean-up

1. RUN `sam delete -t serverless.yml` on projects root folder
2. Choose `Y` for the remaining options
3. Go to AWS console to manually release elastic IP on VPC menu --> Elastic IP submenu

Notes: AWS Cloudformation will not automatically release unused Elastic IP so you have to do it manually to avoid any unnecessary billing.

### Cheers!
